# sauce-jump

This is a simple game where the terrain gets generated based on the runtime behaviour of the used source code (see right panel inside the game). [Iroh.js](https://github.com/maierfelix/Iroh) is used to collect runtime data like ``function calls``, ``loops`` and ``if statements`` and to detect ``eval`` calls.

I hacked this together in a few hours, so don't expect any kind of clean code or a bug free gameplay.
